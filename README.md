# Detection Engineering — Sigma Rules

Cross-source unified Sigma rules for threat detection, built by aggregating and analyzing detection logic from SigmaHQ, Elastic, Splunk ESCU, and Azure Sentinel.

## Rule Sets

### T1059.001 — PowerShell Execution

6 unified Sigma rules covering the full attack lifecycle for PowerShell-based threats.

| Rule | Tier | Level | Log Source | Evasion Resistance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Base64 Encoded Command](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier1_base64_encoded_powershell.yml) | 1 | High | process_creation | Medium |
| [Suspicious Parameter Combination](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier1_susp_parameter_combination.yml) | 1 | High | process_creation | Medium |
| [Download and Execute Pattern](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier1_download_execute_pattern.yml) | 1 | High | process_creation | Medium |
| [Suspicious Parent Process](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier2_suspicious_parent_process.yml) | 2 | Critical | process_creation | High |
| [AMSI Bypass Attempt](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier2_amsi_bypass_attempt.yml) | 2 | Critical | ps_script | High |
| [Malicious Cmdlets via ScriptBlock](rules/t1059_001_powershell/tier2_scriptblock_malicious_cmdlets.yml) | 2 | Critical | ps_script | High |

### Tiering Strategy

- **Tier 1**: High-confidence, broad-coverage rules. Deploy immediately with minimal tuning.
- **Tier 2**: High-value rules requiring environment-specific tuning. ScriptBlock Logging (EventID 4104) must be enabled.

## Custom Metadata Tags

Rules use extended tags to encode detection quality dimensions:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `x-source.sigmahq` | Logic derived from SigmaHQ |
| `x-source.elastic-detection-rules` | Logic derived from Elastic detection-rules |
| `x-source.splunk-escu` | Logic derived from Splunk ESCU |
| `x-source.azure-sentinel` | Logic derived from Azure Sentinel |
| `x-evasion-resistance.high` | Architecturally difficult for adversaries to avoid |
| `x-evasion-resistance.medium` | Bypassable with obfuscation or tool changes |
| `x-drs.dq-coverage` | Mapped to DRS Detection Quality: Coverage dimension |
| `x-drs.dq-precision` | Mapped to DRS Detection Quality: Precision dimension |
| `x-drs.ed-log-evasion-resistance` | Mapped to DRS Evasion Difficulty: Log evasion resistance |
| `x-drs.ed-tool-change-resistance` | Mapped to DRS Evasion Difficulty: Tool change resistance |

## Log Source Requirements

| Log Source | EventID | Required For |
|---|---|---|
| Sysmon EventID 1 / Security 4688 | process_creation | Tier 1 rules |
| PowerShell ScriptBlock Logging | 4104 | Tier 2 ScriptBlock rules |
